## 🧩 AML ETL & Regulatory Simulation

Welcome! I'm Marcin — a data analyst specializing in financial systems, automation, and regulatory analytics.

This simulation project explores how Anti-Money Laundering (AML) controls, ETL pipelines, and regulatory reports can be designed and integrated using Python and SQLite. It simulates the back-office operations of a mid-size financial institution facing compliance requirements and suspicious activity detection.

The goal is to demonstrate:

* Robust data engineering for audit-compliant traceability
* SQL-based risk detection rules
* Automated generation of reports aligned with regulatory standards
