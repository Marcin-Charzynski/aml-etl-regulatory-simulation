## üö® AML Rules & Risk Scoring

This section outlines the rule-based detection engine used to identify suspicious financial activity in the AML ETL & Regulatory Simulation project.

Each rule mimics a behavior commonly associated with money laundering and assigns a score to help prioritize investigative alerts. The system is designed to simulate functionality similar to enterprise tools like Oracle OFSAA and Sygnity SPID.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Rule Set Overview

The following SQL-based rules are implemented and populate the **flagged_txns** table:

1. **Structuring (Smurfing)**  
   - Multiple deposits just under reporting thresholds  
   - 3+ deposits under \$10,000 within a 24-hour period

2. **Velocity (High Transaction Frequency)**  
   - 5 or more transactions from the same account within 30 minutes

3. **High-Risk Geographies**  
   - Transfers involving countries on an internal high-risk list (e.g., Panama, Cayman Islands)

4. **Watchlist Counterparty Match**  
   - Any transaction involving a name that appears on the watchlist_entities table

5. **Dormant Account Reactivation**  
   - Account inactive for over 6 months, then suddenly initiates a transaction

### üìä Risk Score Calculation

Each rule contributes to an aggregated client risk score. Scores can be weighted to reflect the severity or regulatory importance of each risk type.

| Rule                                 | Score Weight |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Structuring (3x < \$10k / 24h)        | 30           |
| Velocity (5+ txns / 30 min)           | 25           |
| High-Risk Country Transfer            | 20           |
| Counterparty Match (Watchlist)        | 15           |
| Reactivated Dormant Account           | 10           |

*Thresholds can be adjusted as per AML policy configuration.*

### üß† Detection Logic Example

<details>
<summary>Click to view SQL</summary>
<pre class="overflow-x-auto bg-gray-800 text-green-400 p-4 rounded-md text-sm font-mono"><code class="language-sql">
WITH recent_deposits AS (
  SELECT 
    account_id,
    timestamp,
    amount
  FROM transactions
  WHERE amount BETWEEN 9000 AND 9999
    AND timestamp >= DATETIME('now', '-1 day')
)
SELECT 
  account_id,
  COUNT(*) AS txn_count
FROM recent_deposits
GROUP BY account_id
HAVING txn_count >= 3;
</code></pre>
</details>

This rule checks for deposit structuring ‚Äî an attempt to avoid reporting thresholds by splitting transactions.

### üßæ Output: flagged_txns Table

All triggered alerts are inserted into the **flagged_txns** table with the following structure:

| Column          | Description                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **flagged_id**    | Unique identifier (autoincrement)          |
| **txn_id**        | ID of the suspicious transaction           |
| **rule_triggered**| Label of the AML rule that was triggered   |
| **reason**        | SQL-generated reasoning for investigation  |

These alerts are used downstream to simulate risk scoring, reporting (CTR/SAR), or case management escalation.

### üîç What's Next?

In the next step, this logic integrates with Power BI to produce dashboards highlighting risk concentration, rule distribution, and geographic exposure. You can also extend the framework to build client-level aggregation or behavioral profiling.
