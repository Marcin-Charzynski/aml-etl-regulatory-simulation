## üìÑ Regulatory Reporting

This section outlines how outputs from the ETL and AML pipeline are converted into structured mock regulatory reports ‚Äî inspired by requirements from institutions like FinCEN, FCA, or EBA.

### üßæ Report Types Simulated

#### 1. **SAR ‚Äì Suspicious Activity Report**

- Generated for customers with risk score ‚â• 60
- Includes:

  - Customer ID, triggered rules, total risk score
  - Summary of behavior and last activity date
- Output Format: CSV & mock PDF

#### 2. **CTR ‚Äì Currency Transaction Report**

- Triggered for individual cash transactions > \$10,000
- Includes:

  - Transaction ID, type, origin/destination countries, amount
  - Entity and time details

#### 3. **SPID-style Filing Summary**

- **regulatory_report table** simulates institutional reporting with the following fields:

  - **report_id** (int)
  - **report_date** (datetime)
  - **flagged_txn_count** (int)
  - **reporting_entity** (text)
  - **submission_time** (datetime)
  - **status** (text: On Time, Late, Missing)

CREATE TABLE regulatory_report AS
SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS report_id,
    DATE(triggered_at) AS report_date,
    COUNT(*) AS flagged_txn_count,
    'ACME AML Engine' AS reporting_entity,
    DATETIME(triggered_at, '+' || ROUND(RANDOM() % 48) || ' hours') AS submission_time,
    CASE
        WHEN submission_time <= DATETIME(report_date, '+24 hours') THEN 'On Time'
        WHEN submission_time IS NULL THEN 'Missing'
        ELSE 'Late'
    END AS status
FROM flagged_txns
GROUP BY report_date;
</code></pre>
</details>

> ‚ùó Submission time delays are simulated to model compliance tracking, and NULLs are introduced to represent missing/incomplete filings.

### üìÇ Output Formats & Storage

- All generated reports are saved in **/output/reports/**
- Formats include **.csv**, mock **.pdf**, and **.json** stubs for further automation
- Each report batch is versioned and timestamped
